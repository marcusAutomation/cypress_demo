CYPRESS DEMO PROJECT AUTOMATION

Page-object-model (POM) is a pattern that you can apply it to develop efficient automation framework. With page-model, it is possible to minimise maintenance cost. Basically page-object means that your every page is inherited from a base class which includes basic functionalities for every pages. If you have some new functionality that every pages have, you can simple add it to the base class.
